Developed using:
- Windows 10
- VTK 9.4.2
- Qt 6
- CMake

CMAKE BUILDING STEPS:
1. Navigate to an empty build folder
2. "cmake .."
3. "cmake --build . --config Release"
4. Run build/Release/QtVTKProject.exe

Program variables can be adjusted in MainWindow.h and require re-building the program.

NOTE: When simulating a grain, the program requires you to select a CSV file for a 2D contour.
It will do this for each generated grain.
